Project description: In this mini-project, we model blood flow in a network of capillaries, and solve the equations using matrices. There are activities for beginners (e.g. high school students) and intermediate activities (e.g. for undergraduates) and more open-ended activities for advanced practitioners (e.g. advanced undergraduates and postgraduates).
